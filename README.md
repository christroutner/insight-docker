# insight-docker
This repository contains a Dockerfile and bash shell scripts for building
a Docker-based Bitpay Insight API server and bitcoin-abc v18.0 full node.
This Dockerfile is based on
[this gist](https://gist.github.com/christroutner/d43eebbe99e155b0558f97e450451124)
walking through the setup of a BCH Insight server. At the moment, an Inisght
server is required by
[rest.bitcoin.com](https://github.com/Bitcoin-com/rest.bitcoin.com) 
API server.
